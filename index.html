			<p>Not only is this site pretty broken, but it's out of date.</p>

			<p>The manifesto was written in a time when it was hard to find high-quality components that weren't tied to heavy,
			"batteries-included" frameworks.</p>

			<p>This has changed. <a href="https://getcomposer.org">Composer</a> and <a href="https://packagist.org">packagist.org</a> have done their job. Most heavy frameworks are made up of components now, and it's reasonable to pick and choose your tools at will.</p>

			<p>PHP dev is in a much better place. Enjoy it. Use the tools you see fit.</p>
